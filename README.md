ðŸŽ­ Emotion Detector using Deep Learning and OpenCV
This project is a Python-based Emotion Detection system that uses a trained deep learning model to identify human emotions from facial expressions in images. The GUI, built with Tkinter, allows users to upload an image, detects faces using OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifier, and classifies emotions such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprise, Neutral, and more using a CNN model.

Technologies Used:
**-Python
-OpenCV
-TensorFlow / Keras
-Tkinter (for GUI)
-PIL (for image processing)**

Features:
-Upload and analyze facial expressions from static images
-Real-time emotion prediction output in the interface
-Lightweight and user-friendly design
